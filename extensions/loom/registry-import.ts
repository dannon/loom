/**
 * The import rule (registry design v3 §10), applied to every registry this
 * session did not sign: a file from an earlier session or a clean clone, a
 * carrier another session wrote, or something hand-made.
 *
 * Consent is session-scoped, so nothing that arrives from outside the session
 * keeps any authority it claims. Approvals and exceptions become `restored`,
 * submission checks become `unchecked`, provenance and evaluations become
 * `historical`, and Galaxy's confirmation of the run is forgotten until
 * reconcile asks again. Attempts recorded against another server are moved to
 * `quarantine`. The result can then be re-established in-session, never
 * inherited.
 *
 * Pure: takes a parsed registry, returns a new one.
