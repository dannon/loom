/**
 * Per-attempt provenance files: `<analysis>/.loom/provenance/<attempt_id>.json`.
 *
 * The notebook block carries a compact summary of each recorded run; this is
 * the full record behind it -- every job's tool, version, effective params,
 * inputs and outputs, as Galaxy reported them. Written only by the harness,
 * into the `.loom/` tree the write jail already protects from the agent's file
 * tools and bash redirects, so it is the half of the record the model cannot
 * edit after the fact.
 *
 * The file is created when the attempt is first recorded (by the submission
 * hook, or by reconcile for a run nobody recorded), and that first write names
 * the Galaxy ids the attempt owns. Enrichment only ever adds job records to a
 * file whose owned ids include the block asking. That matters because the
 * notebook is not protected: `attempt_id` sits in a block the agent can edit,
 * and without the ownership check a block re-pointed at another attempt's id
 * would merge its own jobs into that attempt's record -- a forged attribution
 * written by the harness itself.
 *
 * Writes are atomic (a sibling temp file renamed over the target), refuse to
 * go through a symlink at any level below the analysis directory, and are
 * serialised per file inside this process.
