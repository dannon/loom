/**
 * The reproduction index: the one place ambient lesson injection is justified.
 *
 * A deterministic matcher reaches tool ids, hostnames, file extensions and the
 * wording of a plan step. It cannot answer "is this a reproduction of published
 * work?" -- and that is the motivating case with no failing tool result to
 * hook. Deposited metadata being incomplete is not an error; it is a silently
 * wrong answer three steps later.
 *
 * So, bounded: when the session looks like a reproduction, put the
 * `reproduction/*` lesson TITLES AND IDS -- a handful of lines, rebuilt each
 * turn on the per-turn channel, nothing in the cached prefix -- in front of
 * the model and let it pull bodies with `lessons_search`.
 *
 * Records nothing. It is an index that re-renders every turn, and a
 * `lesson.surfaced` row per listed title per turn would flood the activity log
 * and overstate what happened. The surfacing is recorded when the model
 * actually pulls a body.
