/**
 * Loom <-> Galaxy-flavored-markdown content adapter. notebook.md is canonical.
 *
 * Push replaces each typed notebook fence Loom keeps in the notebook body --
 * `loom-invocation`, `loom-job`, and `loom-session` -- with a hidden carrier
 * holding the literal block, base64-encoded. Galaxy has no renderer for these
 * fence kinds, so a raw one shows up on the page as a "cell type is not
 * available" error. The carrier is a CommonMark link-reference definition
 * (`[loom-<kind>:v1]: #loom "<base64>"`): it renders to nothing and is preserved
 * byte-for-byte on store, so pull restores the original fences exactly.
 * (HTML comments do NOT work here -- Galaxy's page renderer escapes them to
 * visible text rather than hiding them, verified live against 26.1.rc1. A
 * reference definition is pure markdown, so it stays invisible.) base64 keeps
 * the payload free of quotes and newlines, so the carrier is always one
 * well-formed line. `loom-galaxy-page` binding blocks never reach this adapter;
 * the sync helper strips them before push.
 *
 * Invocation and job blocks also get a visible ` ```galaxy ` directive
 * (`invocation_outputs` / `job_parameters`) alongside the carrier when their id
 * validates against the connected server; session blocks are a local ledger
 * and get the carrier only. Pull strips the directives Loom emitted (Loom owns
 * the projection under the loom-canonical model and regenerates them each
 * push). A Loom directive always sits immediately above a carrier with no blank
 * line between, so pull strips only ```galaxy blocks in that position -- a
 * ```galaxy fence a human wrote (or a co-author added on the Galaxy side)
 * survives the round trip.
