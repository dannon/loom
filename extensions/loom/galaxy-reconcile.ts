/**
 * Reconcile: ask Galaxy what is in the history, and make the notebook account
 * for all of it.
 *
 * The submission hook records what it watches happen. What it cannot watch:
 * a turn that died between the submit and the result, a run started from
 * code mode or from Galaxy's own UI while Loom was open, a session resumed
 * after a crash. Galaxy is the source of truth and the notebook is a
 * reconciled projection of it, so this lists the bound history's invocations
 * and jobs and writes a block for every one no block claims -- as
 * `submitted_by: unknown` and `notebook_anchor: unattributed`, because the
 * harness did not see who made it or for which step, and saying so is the
 * point. A `reconcile.unattributed` row goes with each.
 *
 * The other direction too: a block whose id Galaxy now answers "no such
 * thing" for is downgraded to `server_verified: false`, with a warning row.
 * Only a downgrade -- a fresh Galaxy answer is the only thing that sets it
 * true, and that stays the poller's job.
 *
 * Terminal states seen in the listing are not written here. A block that is
 * in flight on disk and finished on Galaxy is handed to the poller's own
 * transition path (`pollGalaxyNow`), so there is one place that decides a run
 * ended, toasts it, and queues the follow-up.
 *
 * Runs on session start (the reconnect path: a session ending never meant the
 * remote work stopped), after `galaxy_connect`, every RECONCILE_EVERY_N_TICKS
 * poller ticks, and on `/reconcile`. Idempotent: a second run over the same
 * history finds every id already claimed and writes nothing.
