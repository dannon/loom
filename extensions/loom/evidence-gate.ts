/**
 * Evidence gate for plan-step completion.
 *
 * Loom's system prompt says "Evidence comes before assertion -- you must run an
 * actual verification step before marking a notebook step complete", and
 * `docs/agent/galaxy-routing.md` is sharper still: "Treat invocation YAML
 * status as Galaxy job state. Treat the plan checkbox as verified-result
 * state." Nothing checked either one. Loom hard-gates what can hurt you
 * (exec-guard, write-jail, destructive deletes) and asked nicely for the thing
 * the product is actually for.
 *
 * ## Deny on contradiction, warn on absence
 *
 * The tempting design -- "block a checkbox flip that arrives without evidence"
 * -- is wrong here, and the codebase says so. `/execute` teaches
 * *evidence-first*: step 5 "Write the verification evidence into the notebook
 * before changing status", step 6 "Only after verification succeeds, edit the
 * markdown checkbox". So a flip-only edit is the **documented honest shape**,
 * and a gate keyed on "this edit added nothing" would fire on exactly the
 * behaviour Loom teaches. Absence of evidence is not decidable from one write:
 * Galaxy evidence lands in a `loom-invocation` block at end of file, prose
 * evidence may sit in a results section, and the honest sequence spans two
 * edits.
 *
 * What *is* decidable is **contradiction**: a claim in the notebook that a
 * record the model can't author disagrees with. There are two such records,
 * so there are two verdict paths.
 *
 * ## The registry path: steps with a recorded run
 *
 * When the approval registry (`registry.ts`) holds an attempt bound to the
 * step that has a submission -- a run the registry knows about -- the verdict
 * is the registry's. The step is held while none of its runs is
 * `handoff_eligible` (recomputed here, so a revocation held in memory counts)
 * and the user hasn't overridden any of them. The evaluation writer
 * (`registry-evaluator.ts`) sets that flag from Galaxy's own answers, and the
 * registry is signed by the session, so nothing in the notebook moves it.
 * Only checkbox states are read from the notebook, by anchor, anywhere in the
 * file:
 *
 * - a held step arriving at `- [x]` is denied, whatever its block's `status:`
 *   says (the old two-edit split);
 * - a held step whose checkbox disappears -- an anchor renamed, the line
 *   fenced, the box broken -- is denied, which is what stops a rename from
 *   carrying a completion past the check in one edit or two;
 * - a plan-heading rename doesn't hide a step, because anchored checkboxes are
 *   found outside `## Plan` sections too.
 *
 * Marking a held step `- [!]` is always allowed. An approval nothing has been
 * submitted for yet is not a run and leaves the step to the legacy path.
 *
 * ## The legacy path: runs the registry doesn't know
 *
 * Until `loom_submit` (registry slice 3) records gated submissions, that is
 * every raw submission. When a plan step flips to `- [x]` while the
 * `loom-invocation` block bound to it still reads `in_progress`, the agent is
 * claiming a verified result for a run Galaxy says has not finished. That
 * status is written by the poller, so it can't be satisfied by writing a
 * convincing sentence -- but it is notebook text, and so is the step's
 * identity, which leaves the three gaps listed below.
 *
 * Everything else is recorded, not blocked. A flip with no invocation binding
 * (a local step, say) gets no opinion at all: guessing there produces the false
 * positives that get gates switched off.
 *
 * ## Modes
 *
 * `off | warn | deny`, from `LOOM_EVIDENCE_GATE` or `evidenceGate.mode` in the
 * config, default `deny`. Every decision that involves a completion is recorded to
 * `activity.jsonl` as `evidence.decision`, with the contradiction's source,
 * so `scripts/evidence-gate-audit.mjs` can tabulate what deny would have done;
 * `docs/evidence-gate-audit.md` holds the result the default rests on.
 *
 * ## The exception is the user's, not the model's
 *
 * The first cut of this gate let the second attempt on a step through, which
 * made the decision advisory: a model that disagrees only has to ask twice. So
 * the deny persists for as long as the contradiction does, and the escape
 * hatch is `/override <step-key> <reason>` (`evidence-override-command.ts`) --
 * a person, a named step, a recorded reason. On the registry path it is
 * written into the registry as an evidence-gate exception on the runs it held
 * the step for; a later run on the step is held again. On the legacy path it
 * is a one-shot token for the run in flight. It is also the way out of the
 * pinned-`in_progress` case: credentials that vanish mid-session, or an
 * invocation that ends with nothing ok and nothing failed.
 *
 * ## What remains
 *
 * 1. **Legacy path, two-edit split.** Rewrite `status:` in one edit, flip the
 *    checkbox in the next: the pre-image already says `completed`.
 * 2. **Legacy path, anchor rename plus flip.** The post-image step key is not
 *    the pre-image's, so it does not read as a flip.
 * 3. **Legacy path, plan-heading rename plus flip.** The step stops parsing.
 *    All three have tests pinning them, and close for raw submissions only
 *    when slice 3 records them in the registry.
 * 4. **Bash.** `WRITE_TOOLS` is `write` and `edit`. On the desktop the
 *    exec-guard denies shell writes to `notebook.md`, `activity.jsonl` and the
 *    registry and provenance directories outright (a floor, not an ask), and
 *    never auto-allows a line that names them, so an interpreter one-liner
 *    asks the user. A script that finds the files itself still can, and is out
 *    of scope for a command-string classifier.
 * 5. **`activity.jsonl` through the file tools.** Not floored there: the
 *    activity log is an audit trail, not an input to any verdict, now that the
 *    verdict lives in the signed registry.
 * 6. **Positional anchors.** A step with no `{#id}` is addressed by position
 *    (`plan-a-step-2`), so inserting a step above it moves its address onto
 *    another line. On the registry path, different text at a held positional
 *    address is treated as that move and refused, which also means a held
 *    positional step can't be retitled until it's eligible; explicit anchors
 *    don't have the problem. */

 * Three properties this depends on, all verified against the code rather than

 *
 * 1. **Read the PRE-image, never the post-image.** The block is ordinary
 *    plaintext in the same file, so an edit that flips the checkbox *and*
 *    rewrites `status: in_progress` to `completed` in one hunk would clear a
 *    post-image check by construction -- the sole deny path defeating itself in
 *    one call. The pre-image is what Galaxy's poller last wrote, before the
 *    edit under adjudication. (A two-edit split -- rewrite status, then flip --
 *    still evades this; see the module note on the out-of-band record.)
 *
 * 2. **`in_progress` only, never `failed`.** `failed` is a rolled-up
 *    any-job-errored verdict, it is sticky, and `checkInvocations` polls only
 *    `in_progress` blocks (`tools.ts:650`) so it can never be re-polled back
 *    out. Denying on it would block the legitimate flip after a successful
 *    rerun, with no remediation the agent could actually execute.
 *
 * 3. **Anchors are not unique.** `upsertInvocationBlock` keys on
 *    `invocation_id` (`notebook-writer.ts:283`), so a rerun leaves a second
 *    block with the same `notebook_anchor`. If ANY block for the anchor reads
 *    `completed`, the step is not contradicted -- the common retry shape is a
 *    stale `failed`/`in_progress` block beside the fresh `completed` one, and
 *    failing open there is the difference between a gate people keep and a
 *    gate people switch off.

 *    matched: insert a `[ ]` into a prose line, then "flip" that, and the
 *    simulator saw a checkbox appear in prose while pi -- matching the second
 *    edit against the original -- flipped the real plan step.
 * 2. **A non-unique `oldText` is refused outright** (`getDuplicateError`), and
 *    so is an overlapping pair. Abstaining on those is not a gap: the call
 *    errors and nothing reaches the disk.
 * 3. **Line endings are normalized to LF first.** A `newText` ending `\r\n`
 *    left a stray CR in the simulated line, which `STEP_LINE` then failed to
 *    parse, so the completion disappeared from the post-image while pi wrote
