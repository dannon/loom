/**
 * Web-mode gate -- Pi extension loaded by web/server.ts when LOOM_MODE=remote.
 *
 * Default-DENY allowlist for the remote brain's tool surface. The agent may
 * only reach the curated remote surface:
 *   - Galaxy / BRC-Analytics MCP tools (mcp__galaxy__*, mcp__brc_analytics__*)
 *     and the brain's own Galaxy tools (galaxy_*)
 *   - the brain's HTTP helper tools (gtn_*, notebook_*, skills_fetch)
 *   - path-gated edit/write/read, confined to the session notebook.md
 * Everything else -- bash/grep/find/ls, the pi-web-access egress tools
 * (fetch_content/web_search/code_search/get_search_content), experiment-gated
 * team/chat tools, and anything added to the brain in the future -- is blocked.
 * Enumerating the keep-set rather than the block-set means a newly added tool
 * is closed by default instead of silently reachable.
 *
 * In remote mode this gate is the SOLE tool_call authority: web/server.ts sets
 * LOOM_LOCAL_EXEC=off so the brain skips its local-execution guard (there is no
 * local execution surface to guard in a container). The gate therefore can't
 * lean on that guard for the malformed-input case -- it normalizes
 * `path ?? file_path` the same way pi's file tools do before the jail check.
 *
 * Path comparisons walk the deepest existing prefix through realpath so a
 * pre-existing symlink in `/tmp/loom-session/` can't redirect a gated tool
 * to a file outside the allowlist. The pure helpers are exported for unit
 * tests.
